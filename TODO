- Update dependencies (turbo, eslint, pnpm, nextjs, etc.)
- Move the root dependencies to devDependencies (they all are)
- Rename scryfall's index.ts to ingest.ts or something more descriptive
- Make the location of the scryfall download (and any created file) configurable
- Use tsup not tsc for scryfall build step?
- Check mtime of downloaded scryfall file and don't re-download if we already have latest
- Make the new Scryfall database "off to one  side" and then swap it in when it's ready
- Break apart fetching scryfall bulk data to the filesystem and parsing the bulk data and inserting into db
- Some retry logic (or via lib) for downloading
- format table
- face table
- More unique constraints could be added to the Scryfall stuff, what we have is pretty arbitrary
- Does the bulk data we're fetching include non-English card info? Should it?
